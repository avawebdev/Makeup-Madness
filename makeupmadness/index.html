<h1>Is colourpop releasing too often?</h1>
<p>Colourpop is known for its fast-fast like business model. But has it gotten so fast its overwhelming consumers? </p> <br><p>Just
  this year Colourpop has had <strong>30 new
    palettes released</strong>.
  Beauty influencers are taking notice at the makeup moguls super packed release schedule. Some are even refusing to buy Colourpop products because of environmental
  and ethical reasons. Beauty gurus and influencers alike beg makeup companies to slow down their production and focus more on quality <br>rather than quantity.
  Brands like ABH, Colourpop, Nyx and Too Faced have been called out on their poor quailty as of late. <p>Reddit user <em>JenFan91</em> says <q>Yeah, Colourpop is basically the fast fashion/H&M of the makeup <br>world. It's way easier for them to release
  a bunch of stuff at once, see what the winners and losers are, and then discontinue the losers while making more of the winners. They don't have to go "all in" on a few products and can get real-time product
  feedback just seeing how their sales go.</q>
